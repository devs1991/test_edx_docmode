    course keys, which can have a number of chars that break admin URLs.
    There's probably a way to make this work properly, but I don't have the
    time to investigate. I would normally disable the links by setting
    `list_display_links = None`, but that's not a valid value for that
    field in Django 1.4. So I'm left with creating a page where the detail
    view links are all broken for Split courses. Because I only created
    this page to manually test a hotfix, the list view works for this
    purpose, and that's all the yak I have time to shave today.
