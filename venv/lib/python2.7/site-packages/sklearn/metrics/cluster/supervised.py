def adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred):
    """Rand index adjusted for chance

    The Rand Index computes a similarity measure between two clusterings
    by considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are
    assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and
    true clusterings.

    The raw RI score is then "adjusted for chance" into the ARI score
    using the following scheme::

        ARI = (RI - Expected_RI) / (max(RI) - Expected_RI)

    The adjusted Rand index is thus ensured to have a value close to
    0.0 for random labeling independently of the number of clusters and
    samples and exactly 1.0 when the clusterings are identical (up to
    a permutation).

    ARI is a symmetric measure::

        adjusted_rand_score(a, b) == adjusted_rand_score(b, a)

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels_true : int array, shape = [n_samples]

    labels_pred : array, shape = [n_samples]

    -------
    ari: float
       Similarity score between -1.0 and 1.0. Random labelings have an ARI
       close to 0.0. 1.0 stands for perfect match.

    --------

    Perfectly maching labelings have a score of 1 even

      >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import adjusted_rand_score
      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
      1.0
      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
      1.0

    Labelings that assign all classes members to the same clusters

      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1, 1])  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      0.57...

    ARI is symmetric, so labelings that have pure clusters with members
    coming from the same classes but unnecessary splits are penalized::

      >>> adjusted_rand_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 2])  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      0.57...

    If classes members are completely split across different clusters, the

def normalized_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred):
    """Normalized Mutual Information between two clusterings

    Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is an normalization of the Mutual
    Information (MI) score to scale the results between 0 (no mutual
    information) and 1 (perfect correlation).

    This measure is not adjusted for chance. Therefore
    ``adjusted_mustual_info_score`` might be preferred.

    This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels:
    a permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the
    score value in any way.

    This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching `label_true` with
    `label_pred` will return the same score value. This can be useful to
    measure the agreement of two independent label assignments strategies
    on the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels_true : int array, shape = [n_samples]
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.

    labels_pred : array, shape = [n_samples]
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.

    Returns
    -------
    nmi: float
       score between 0.0 and 1.0. 1.0 stands for perfectly complete labeling

    See also
    --------
    adjusted_rand_score: Adjusted Rand Index
    adjusted_mutual_info_score: Adjusted Mutual Information (adjusted
        against chance)

    Examples
    --------

    Perfect labelings are both homogeneous and complete, hence have
    score 1.0::

      >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import normalized_mutual_info_score
      >>> normalized_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
      1.0
      >>> normalized_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
      1.0

    If classes members are completly splitted across different clusters,
    the assignment is totally in-complete, hence the NMI is null::

      >>> normalized_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3])
      0.0
