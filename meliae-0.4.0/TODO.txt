Things to do
============

A fairly random collection of things to work on next...

1) Generating a Calltree output.

   I haven't yet understood the calltree syntax, nor how I want to
   exactly match things. Certainly you don't have FILE/LINE to put into
   the output.

   Also, look at generating `runsnakerun`_ output.

2) Other analysis tools, like walking the ref graph.

   I'm thinking something similar to PDB, which could let you walk
   up-and-down the reference graph, to let you figure out why that one
   string is being cached, by going through the 10 layers of references.
   At the moment, you can do this using '*' in Vim, which is at least a
   start, and one reason to use a text-compatible dump format.

3) Dump differencing utilities.

   This probably will make it a bit easier to see where memory is
   increasing, rather than just where it is at right now.

4) Full cross-platform and version compatibility testing.

   I'd like to support python2.4+, 32/64-bit, Win/Linux/Mac. I've tested
   a couple variants, but I don't have all of them to make sure it works
   everywhere.
