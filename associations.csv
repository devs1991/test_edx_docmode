As a result blood sugar levels rise to a dangerous level. 
It is a serious condition that needs controlling and maintaining to avoid complications.
When a person eats sugars and starches, the body changes them rapidly into a sugar called glucose.

Glucose is the main source of body energy. Your liver produces some glucose and you get the rest through the above digestion process. It is absorbed from the intestine and is metabolized and used immediately where it is needed by all cells in the body via glucose transportation, and the rest is stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen for future requirement. 
In diabetes, the mechanism that controls the amount of glucose in the blood breaks down. The blood glucose level rises to dangerously high levels as a result, causing symptoms and damage to the body.

Glucose is transported by a signal produced by insulin. After transportation insulin triggers its correct dispersion.

Insulin is a hormone (part of the endocrine system) produced by beta cells (islets of Langerhans) in the pancreas. It manages how much glucose the liver produces and helps glucose to be taken up by the cells where it is used as energy. Insulin acts as a key to unlock the cells so that blood sugar can be stored in them. High blood sugar levels can be related to not enough keys (insulin), or an inefficient lock (cell entry point), or both.

Seizure symptoms vary. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs.

About 1 in 100 people in the United States may have an unprovoked seizure once in life. However, a solitary seizure doesn\'t mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis.

Even mild seizures may require treatment because they can be dangerous during activities such as driving or swimming. Treatment, which generally includes medications or sometimes surgery, may eliminate or reduce the frequency and intensity of seizures. Some children with epilepsy even outgrow the condition with age.

Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing up against the blood vessel walls. The higher the pressure the harder the heart has to pump.

Hypertension can lead to damaged organs, as well as several illnesses, such as renal failure (kidney failure), aneurysm, heart failure, stroke, or heart attack. Researchers from UC Davis reported in the Journal of the American Academy of Neurology that high blood pressure during middle age may raise the risk of cognitive decline later in life.

According to Medilexicon\'s medical dictionary, hypertension means \""High blood pressure; transitory or sustained elevation of systemic arterial blood pressure to a level likely to induce cardiovascular damage or other adverse consequences.\""

The normal level for blood pressure is below 120/80, where 120 represents the systolic measurement (peak pressure in the arteries) and 80 represents the diastolic measurement (minimum pressure in the arteries). Blood pressure between 120/80 and 139/89 is called prehypertension (to denote increased risk of hypertension), and a blood pressure of 140/90 or above is considered hypertension.

Hypertension may be classified as essential or secondary. Essential hypertension is the term for high blood pressure with unknown cause. It accounts for about 95% of cases. Secondary hypertension is the term for high blood pressure with a known direct cause, such as kidney disease, tumors, or birth control pills.

Some 70 million adults in the United States are affected by hypertension. The condition also affects about two million teens and children. According to a report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in September 2012, over half all Americans with hypertension do not have their high blood pressure under control.

Essential update: New evidence-based guidelines for the management of pediatric acne
The American Academy of Pediatrics has endorsed the recommendations of the American Acne and Rosacea Society for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne.[2] The evidence-based guidelines used age and pubertal status to delineate classification, diagnosis, evaluation, and management, as well as special concerns such as the psychosocial effects of acne, treatment adherence, and dietary considerations.

The following are among recommendations presented for adolescent, preadolescent, infant, and neonatal acne[2] :

Benzoyl peroxide is generally safe and effective as monotherapy or when used in topical combination products for mild acne
Topical retinoids may be used either as monotherapy or in combination with other products and in therapeutic regimens for all types and severities of acne in children and adolescents of all ages
Oral antibiotics may be used for moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne for any age (except for tetracycline in children younger than 8 years)

Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. However, cholesterol also is found in some of the foods you eat.

Cholesterol travels through your bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins (lip-o-PRO-teens). These packages are made of fat (lipid) on the inside and proteins on the outside.

Two kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout your body: low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Having healthy levels of both types of lipoproteins is important.

LDL cholesterol sometimes is called “bad” cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. (Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.)

HDL cholesterol sometimes is called “good” cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.

High blood cholesterol is a condition in which you have too much cholesterol in your blood. By itself, the condition usually has no signs or symptoms. Thus, many people don’t know that their cholesterol levels are too high.

People who have high blood cholesterol have a greater chance of getting coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. (In this article, the term “heart disease” refers to coronary heart disease.)

The higher the level of LDL cholesterol in your blood, the GREATER your chance is of getting heart disease. The higher the level of HDL cholesterol in your blood, the LOWER your chance is of getting heart disease.

Coronary heart disease is a condition in which plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary (heart) arteries. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis).

Diabetes and hypertension are deadly duo; a diabetic person is at a greater risk of cardiovascular disease than people without diabetes. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality for people with diabetes and therefore need of the hour is strict BP control.
According to a study published in the noted journal Lancet, India is just behind US and China in this global hazard list of top 10 countries with highest number of obese people. Obesity and hypertension are linked, with obese patients having higher rates of hypertension than normal-weight individuals.
Also Long standing hypertension often leads to end organ damage.
To battle hypertension Zuventus presents Excellence in cardiac care-1 , webinar CME with focus on “Emerging role of Chlorthalidone and ARB+ Chlorthalidone in management of Indian co-morbid hypertensives”. We are sure this Zuventus initiative will bring out the best in management of co-morbid hypertensives.",,"1"

In addition there is an ever-increasing need for spread of evidence based teaching for the treatment of bone sarcomas. This can be achieved with collaborative efforts of industry and the academic bodies and to achieve this, we have planned this academic initiative, which will help in spreading the necessitated knowledge about this most feared Sub specialty of Orthopedics.
This webinar will provide unparalleled opportunities to the orthopedic surgeons to listen to didactic lectures from the experts in the field of orthopedic oncology and experience on limb salvage reconstruction.
We will try to utilize this opportunity to the best of our levels to achieve our aim of providing evidence based approach for reconstruction of bone defects after tumor excision. We are planning a holistic scientific program to suit the educational needs of professionals and trainees in orthopaedic specialties through this webinar.",,"1"
